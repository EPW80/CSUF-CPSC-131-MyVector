# CSUF-CPSC131-MyVector

A project aimed at implementing a custom vector class from scratch in C++. This custom vector class, aptly named MyVector, replicates most of the functionality of the std::vector class that comes with the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. Among other features, the MyVector class has the ability to dynamically resize, just like std::vector.

## Technologies Used

This project is implemented using:

- C++: A powerful high-level programming language that provides high performance and is suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Key Features

- Similar to std::vector, MyVector class supports dynamic resizing.

- Other functionalities will be added over time to match the standard std::vector class as closely as possible.

## Language

- C++
